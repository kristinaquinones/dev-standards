# Channel Strategy

## Overview

Channel strategy helps you choose where to reach and engage your target audience. This document covers frameworks for selecting, evaluating, and managing marketing channels without prescribing specific tools or platforms.

## Channel Selection Framework

### What is a Marketing Channel?

A marketing channel is a way you reach and communicate with your target audience. Examples include email, social media, content marketing, paid advertising, events, partnerships, and more.

### Channel Selection Process

**Step 1: Understand Your Audience**
- Where does your target audience spend time?
- How do they discover new products?
- What channels do they trust?
- Use [user research](../product-docs/user-research-discovery.md) to answer these questions

**Step 2: Identify Potential Channels**
- List all channels where your audience might be
- Consider both online and offline channels
- Don't limit yourself to obvious choices

**Step 3: Evaluate Each Channel**
- Use the evaluation framework below
- Score each channel objectively
- Focus on channels that align with your audience and resources

**Step 4: Select Your Channel Mix**
- Start with 1-3 channels (don't spread too thin)
- Choose channels that complement each other
- Plan to test and iterate

### Channel Evaluation Framework

Evaluate channels using these criteria:

**Audience Fit:**
- Does your target audience use this channel?
- How actively do they engage on this channel?
- Is this where they look for solutions to their problems?

**Resource Requirements:**
- What resources does this channel need? (time, money, skills)
- Do you have the resources to execute well?
- Can you sustain this channel over time?

**Scalability:**
- Can this channel grow with you?
- What are the limits to growth on this channel?
- How does cost change as you scale?

**Measurability:**
- Can you measure results on this channel?
- What metrics matter for this channel?
- How will you track performance?

**Control:**
- How much control do you have over messaging and delivery?
- What dependencies exist (platform changes, algorithm changes)?
- What risks come with this channel?

**Timeline:**
- How quickly can you see results?
- Does this channel require long-term investment?
- When will you know if it's working?

### Channel Mix Considerations

**Start Small:**
- Focus on 1-3 channels initially
- Master a few channels before adding more
- Better to do a few channels well than many poorly

**Complementary Channels:**
- Choose channels that work together
- One channel can feed another (e.g., content → email)
- Consider how channels support each other

**Diversification:**
- Don't rely on a single channel
- Balance between owned, earned, and paid channels
- Reduce risk by having multiple ways to reach audiences

**Resource Balance:**
- Consider your available resources
- Some channels require more time, others more money
- Balance channels based on what you can sustain

## Channel-Specific Considerations

### Owned Channels

**Characteristics:**
- You control the channel (your website, email list, etc.)
- Direct relationship with your audience
- Long-term value that compounds

**Considerations:**
- Requires consistent investment
- Takes time to build
- Provides sustainable, long-term value

### Earned Channels

**Characteristics:**
- Others share or talk about you (PR, word-of-mouth, etc.)
- Credibility from third-party validation
- Often requires building relationships

**Considerations:**
- Less control over messaging
- Can be unpredictable
- High credibility when it works

### Paid Channels

**Characteristics:**
- You pay to reach audiences (advertising, sponsorships, etc.)
- Immediate reach and control
- Scalable with budget

**Considerations:**
- Costs scale with usage
- Requires ongoing investment
- Need to measure ROI carefully

## Channel Management

### Testing Channels

**Start with Hypotheses:**
- What do you expect from this channel?
- How will you measure success?
- What would make you continue or stop?

**Run Experiments:**
- Test channels with small investments
- Measure results objectively
- Use [A/B testing frameworks](../measurement-docs/ab-testing-experimentation.md) when applicable

**Evaluate and Decide:**
- Give channels enough time to show results
- Make data-driven decisions
- Don't be afraid to stop channels that don't work

### Measuring Channel Performance

**Key Metrics:**
- Reach: How many people see your message?
- Engagement: How do people interact with your content?
- Conversion: How many take the desired action?
- Cost: What does it cost to acquire a customer through this channel?

**Channel Analytics:**
- Track metrics for each channel
- Compare channels to understand relative performance
- Use [analytics strategy](../measurement-docs/analytics-strategy.md) for measurement

**Attribution:**
- Understand which channels contribute to outcomes
- Recognize that customers often use multiple channels
- Focus on overall impact, not just last-touch attribution

### Channel Optimization

**Regular Review:**
- Review channel performance regularly
- Identify what's working and what's not
- Make adjustments based on data

**Resource Allocation:**
- Invest more in channels that work
- Reduce or stop channels that don't
- Rebalance resources as you learn

**Continuous Improvement:**
- Test different approaches within channels
- Learn from what works
- Iterate and improve over time

## Channel Strategy Best Practices

- **Start with Your Audience**: Choose channels where your audience actually is
- **Focus on Quality**: Better to do fewer channels well than many poorly
- **Test and Learn**: Don't assume channels will work; test them
- **Measure Everything**: Use data to make channel decisions
- **Be Patient**: Some channels take time to show results
- **Stay Flexible**: Be willing to change channels as you learn

## Common Pitfalls

**Spreading Too Thin:**
- Trying too many channels at once
- Not doing any channel well
- Solution: Focus on 1-3 channels initially

**Ignoring Your Audience:**
- Choosing channels you like, not where your audience is
- Not validating channel fit
- Solution: Start with audience research

**Not Measuring:**
- Not tracking channel performance
- Making decisions based on assumptions
- Solution: Set up measurement from the start

**Chasing Trends:**
- Jumping on new channels without evaluation
- Not considering if it fits your audience
- Solution: Evaluate channels objectively
