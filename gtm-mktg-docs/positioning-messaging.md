# Positioning & Messaging

## Overview

Positioning defines how your product fits in the market and how it's different from alternatives. Messaging translates that positioning into communication that resonates with your target audience. This document covers frameworks for developing and testing positioning and messaging.

## Positioning Framework

### What is Positioning?

Positioning is how you want your product to be perceived in the minds of your target audience relative to alternatives. It answers: "What is this product, who is it for, and why should they care?"

### Positioning Statement Structure

A positioning statement follows this framework:

**For [target audience], [product name] is [category] that [key benefit]. Unlike [alternatives], [product name] [differentiator].**

**Components:**
- **Target Audience**: Who is this for?
- **Category**: What type of product is this?
- **Key Benefit**: What value does it deliver?
- **Alternatives**: What else do people use instead?
- **Differentiator**: What makes it unique?

### Developing Positioning

**Step 1: Understand Your Audience**
- Use [user research](../product-docs/user-research-discovery.md) to understand target users
- Identify their needs, pain points, and goals
- Understand how they currently solve the problem

**Step 2: Identify Alternatives**
- What do people use instead of your product?
- This includes competitors, substitutes, and "doing nothing"
- Understand the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives

**Step 3: Define Your Differentiator**
- What makes your product uniquely valuable?
- Focus on benefits that matter to your audience
- Be specific and credible

**Step 4: Test Your Positioning**
- Validate with target users
- Test if it's clear, credible, and compelling
- Iterate based on feedback

### Value Proposition Framework

A value proposition clearly states the value your product delivers. Use this structure:

**We help [target audience] [achieve outcome] by [how you do it] so they can [bigger benefit].**

**Example:**
"We help solo founders track their product metrics by providing simple, visual dashboards so they can make data-driven decisions without hiring analysts."

### Positioning Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Vague positioning doesn't help anyone
- **Focus on Benefits**: What value do users get, not just features
- **Be Credible**: Can you actually deliver on this positioning?
- **Test with Users**: Don't assume your positioning resonates
- **Keep It Simple**: One clear idea, not multiple messages

## Messaging Framework

### Messaging Hierarchy

Organize your messaging in layers from high-level to specific:

**Level 1: Core Message**
- The single most important thing to communicate
- Should align with your positioning
- Simple and memorable

**Level 2: Supporting Messages**
- 3-5 key points that support the core message
- Each addresses a different aspect or benefit
- Should work together to tell a complete story

**Level 3: Proof Points**
- Specific examples, data, or stories that support messages
- Make messages credible and concrete
- Can vary by audience or use case

### Audience Segmentation for Messaging

Different audiences may need different messaging:

**Segment by:**
- **Role**: Different roles have different priorities
- **Use Case**: Different use cases emphasize different benefits
- **Stage**: New users vs. experienced users need different information
- **Pain Point**: Different problems require different solutions

**Messaging Adaptation:**
- Keep core positioning consistent
- Adapt supporting messages and proof points
- Test which messages resonate with each segment

### Message Development Process

**Step 1: Start with Positioning**
- Your messaging should reflect your positioning
- Core message should align with positioning statement

**Step 2: Identify Key Benefits**
- What are the 3-5 most important benefits?
- Prioritize based on what matters to your audience
- Use [user research](../product-docs/user-research-discovery.md) to validate

**Step 3: Develop Supporting Messages**
- One message per key benefit
- Make each message clear and specific
- Ensure messages work together

**Step 4: Add Proof Points**
- Support each message with evidence
- Use examples, data, or stories
- Make messages credible

**Step 5: Test and Refine**
- Test messages with target audiences
- Measure which messages resonate
- Iterate based on feedback and data

### Messaging Best Practices

- **Start with User Needs**: What matters to your audience?
- **Be Clear**: Avoid jargon and complexity
- **Be Consistent**: Core positioning should be consistent across all messaging
- **Be Flexible**: Adapt supporting messages for different contexts
- **Test Everything**: Don't assume messages work; validate with users

## Testing Positioning and Messaging

### Qualitative Testing

**User Interviews:**
- Ask users to describe your product in their own words
- Test if your positioning is clear and memorable
- Identify what resonates and what doesn't

**Message Testing:**
- Present different messages to users
- Ask which messages are most compelling
- Understand why certain messages work better

### Quantitative Testing

**A/B Testing:**
- Test different positioning or messaging in real contexts
- Measure which performs better
- Use [A/B testing frameworks](../measurement-docs/ab-testing-experimentation.md) for proper testing

**Analytics:**
- Track how messaging affects user behavior
- Measure conversion, engagement, or other key metrics
- Use [analytics strategy](../measurement-docs/analytics-strategy.md) to measure impact
