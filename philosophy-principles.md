## Development Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness

Code should be easy to read and understand. Write code that someone else (or future you) can understand quickly.

- Make code readable first, optimize second
- Be explicit about what you're doing
- Explain the "why" behind complex decisions, not just the "what"

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

Avoid copying and pasting code. Instead, create reusable pieces that can be shared.

- Extract shared logic into utilities or libraries
- Refactor instead of duplicating code
- Keep a single source of truth for important logic

### You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)

Build what you need now, not what you might need later.

- Focus on current requirements
- Avoid building features "just in case"
- Add complexity only when you actually need it

### Fail Fast and Visibly

Catch problems early and make them obvious when they happen.

- Use tools to catch errors before they cause problems (type checking, tests)
- Handle errors explicitly; don't let them fail silently
- Make error messages helpful and actionable

### Documentation is Code

Treat documentation with the same care as code.

- Keep documentation in version control with your code
- Review and update documentation like you do code
- Outdated documentation is worse than no documentation

### Consistency Matters

Follow established patterns so others can understand your work quickly.

- Use consistent naming and file organization
- Automate style checks when possible
- Make patterns obvious so new people can follow them

## Product Principles

### User-Centricity

Start with what users need, not what features you want to build.

- Understand user problems before building solutions
- Validate your assumptions with real users
- Measure success by how well you solve user problems, not by how many features you ship

### Evidence-Based Decisions

Make decisions based on data and research, not just opinions or hunches.

- Use data, user research, and experiments to guide decisions
- Hunches and intuition can generate ideas, but validate them with data before committing
- Balance what users tell you (qualitative) with what they actually do (quantitative)
- Test your assumptions and learn from what doesn't work

### Strategic Thinking

Connect your daily work to bigger goals.

- Understand how your work fits into the product vision
- Balance short-term needs with long-term goals
- Consider the ripple effects of your decisions
- Say "no" to good ideas that don't align with strategy

### Clarity and Communication

Make sure everyone understands the "why" behind decisions.

- Explain why you're doing something, not just what you're doing
- Make complex ideas simple and accessible
- Get everyone aligned around shared understanding
- Document decisions so people remember why they were made

### Ruthless Prioritization

Focus on what matters most. Not everything can be important.

- Be clear about what you're not doing
- Make trade-offs explicit and transparent
- Use frameworks to help prioritize objectively
- Revisit priorities as you learn and context changes

### Iterative Improvement

Ship, learn, and improve rather than trying to perfect everything before launch.

- Start small, validate, then scale up
- Embrace experimentation and calculated risks
- Continuously improve based on what you learn
- Don't wait for perfection before shipping

### Outcome Over Output

Focus on results, not activity.

- Measure impact, not just how much you built
- Define success metrics before you start building
- Be willing to change direction when outcomes don't match expectations
- Focus on user and product outcomes, not feature counts

## Shared Principles

### Collaboration and Empowerment

Work together effectively and give people what they need to succeed.

- Share context so people can make good decisions
- Build trust through transparency and follow-through
- Create space for different perspectives and healthy debate
- Empower people with the information they need

### Continuous Learning

Always be learning and improving.

- Learn from failures and successes
- Acknowledge uncertainty and test your assumptions
- Improve processes and outcomes over time
- Stay curious and open to new approaches
