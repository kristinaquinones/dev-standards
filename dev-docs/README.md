## About this document

This index file provides access to all development standards, which have been organized into discrete markdown files in this directory. This reorganization makes the standards easier to navigate, maintain, and reference.

Each section contains detailed guidelines, examples, checklists, and best practices for that particular aspect of software development. All standards are designed to be:
- **Project-agnostic**: Applicable to any software project
- **Universal**: Can be adapted to different tech stacks and team structures
- **Comprehensive**: Cover all aspects of software development
- **Maintainable**: Organized for easy updates and cross-referencing
