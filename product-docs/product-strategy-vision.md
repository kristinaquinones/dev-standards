# Product Strategy & Vision

## Overview

Product strategy defines the direction and approach for achieving product goals, while vision articulates the long-term aspiration. Strategy connects the product vision to tactical execution through clear principles and priorities.

## Vision development

### What is a Product Vision?

A product vision describes the desired future state (what the product will become and the impact it will have). It should be:
- **Aspirational**: Inspires and motivates the team
- **Clear**: Easy to understand and communicate
- **Stable**: Endures over time, even as tactics change
- **User-focused**: Centers on user outcomes, not features

### Vision Statement Framework

A strong vision statement typically includes:
- **Who** the product serves (target users)
- **What** problem it solves or opportunity it creates
- **Why** it matters (the impact or outcome)
- **How** it's different (unique value proposition)

## Strategy development

### Strategic Pillars

Product strategy should be built on clear pillars that guide decision-making:

1. **Market Position**: Where do we compete and how do we win?
2. **User Segments**: Which users do we prioritize and why?
3. **Value Proposition**: What unique value do we deliver?
4. **Value Creation Model**: How does the product create value for users and stakeholders?
5. **Competitive Advantage**: What makes us hard to copy?

Strategic decisions should be validated with data. Use user research, market analysis, and experiments to test strategic assumptions before committing to major directions.

### Strategy vs. Tactics

- **Strategy**: The "what" and "why" (what we're trying to achieve and why it matters)
- **Tactics**: The "how" (specific features, initiatives, or actions)
- Strategy should inform tactics; tactics should be evaluated against strategy

## Strategic planning

### Time Horizons

- **Vision**: 3-5+ years (aspirational future state)
- **Strategy**: 1-3 years (how we'll achieve the vision)
- **Roadmap**: 3-12 months (tactical plan)
- **Sprints/Releases**: 1-4 weeks (immediate execution)

### Strategic Questions

When developing or refining strategy, consider:
- What market trends will shape our product's future?
- What user needs are underserved or emerging?
- What capabilities do we need to build or acquire?
- What constraints or risks might impact our path?
- How will we measure strategic progress?

**Validating Strategic Assumptions:**

Validate strategic assumptions with data and experiments before committing to major strategic shifts. For example, if you believe a new market segment is valuable, use user research to understand their needs, then run experiments to validate demand before building a full product line. Answers to strategic questions should be validated with data, not assumptions.

## Communication

### Stakeholder Alignment

- Share vision and strategy widely and frequently
- Connect individual work to strategic goals
- Use consistent language and frameworks
- Create visual representations (vision boards, strategy diagrams)
- Revisit and refresh strategy regularly

### Documentation

- Document strategic decisions and rationale
- Keep strategy documents accessible and up-to-date
- Link roadmaps and features back to strategy
- Reference strategy in [prioritization](prioritization-frameworks.md) discussions
