# Stakeholder Management

## Overview

Effective stakeholder management ensures alignment, clear communication, and successful product delivery. This involves identifying stakeholders, understanding their needs, and maintaining productive relationships.

## Stakeholder identification

### Types of Stakeholders

**Internal Stakeholders:**
- Executive leadership
- Engineering teams
- Design teams
- Sales and marketing
- Customer success
- Support teams
- Finance and operations

**External Stakeholders:**
- Users and customers
- Partners and vendors
- Investors and board members
- Industry analysts and press

### Stakeholder Mapping

Map stakeholders by:
- **Influence**: How much they can impact product decisions
- **Interest**: How much they care about product outcomes
- **Impact**: How much the product affects them

**High Influence, High Interest:**
- Key stakeholders; engage closely
- Regular communication and collaboration
- Involve in major decisions

**High Influence, Low Interest:**
- Keep satisfied; provide updates
- Don't overwhelm with details
- Alert to major changes

**Low Influence, High Interest:**
- Keep informed; provide transparency
- May be advocates or champions
- Can provide valuable feedback

**Low Influence, Low Interest:**
- Monitor; minimal communication
- Provide updates as needed
- Don't invest excessive time

## Communication strategies

### Communication Principles

- **Right Message, Right Time**: Tailor communication to stakeholder needs
- **Proactive, Not Reactive**: Share updates before being asked
- **Transparent**: Be honest about challenges and trade-offs
- **Consistent**: Regular cadence builds trust
- **Two-Way**: Listen as much as you communicate

### Communication Channels

**Synchronous:**
- One-on-one meetings
- Team standups
- Stakeholder reviews
- All-hands presentations

**Asynchronous:**
- Email updates
- Documentation and wikis
- Slack/Teams channels
- Roadmap and status dashboards

### Communication Frequency

- **Daily**: Engineering and design teams (standups, Slack)
- **Weekly**: Key stakeholders (status updates, progress reports)
- **Monthly**: Broader stakeholder group (roadmap reviews, metrics)
- **Quarterly**: Executive leadership (strategy reviews, planning)

## Stakeholder alignment

### Aligning on Goals

- **Shared Understanding**: Ensure everyone understands product goals
- **Clear Success Metrics**: Define what success looks like together
- **Trade-off Transparency**: Make decisions and trade-offs explicit
- **Regular Check-ins**: Validate alignment hasn't drifted

### Managing Expectations

- **Set Realistic Expectations**: Under-promise, over-deliver when possible
- **Communicate Constraints**: Share limitations and dependencies
- **Explain Decisions**: Provide context for prioritization choices
- **Update as Context Changes**: Keep stakeholders informed of changes

### Handling Conflicts

- **Listen First**: Understand different perspectives
- **Find Common Ground**: Identify shared goals
- **Use Data**: Base decisions on evidence, not opinions or hunches. When stakeholders disagree, use data to resolve: gather user research, run experiments, or analyze analytics to validate different perspectives
- **Escalate When Needed**: Involve leadership for unresolved conflicts
- **Document Decisions**: Record decisions and rationale

## Stakeholder engagement

### Involving Stakeholders

**Discovery Phase:**
- Gather input and requirements
- Validate assumptions
- Understand constraints and opportunities

**Planning Phase:**
- Review and provide feedback on plans
- Validate priorities and scope
- Identify dependencies and risks

**Development Phase:**
- Provide clarifications and context
- Review progress and provide feedback
- Make decisions on trade-offs

**Launch Phase:**
- Prepare for launch (sales, marketing, support)
- Share updates and gather feedback
- Measure and communicate results

### Stakeholder Reviews

**Roadmap Reviews:**
- Share strategic direction and priorities
- Gather feedback on planned work
- Adjust based on stakeholder input

**Feature Reviews:**
- Present feature plans and requirements
- Validate user needs and product value
- Identify concerns and dependencies

**Retrospectives:**
- Review what went well and what didn't
- Gather feedback on process and collaboration
- Identify improvements for next time

## Best practices

- **Build Relationships**: Invest time in understanding stakeholders
- **Be Proactive**: Don't wait for problems to communicate
- **Be Honest**: Transparency builds trust, even with bad news
- **Use Data to Resolve Disagreements**: When stakeholders have different opinions about priorities, use data to resolve. For example, if one stakeholder thinks feature A is more valuable and another thinks feature B is, design an experiment to test both and let the data decide
- **Show Progress**: Regular updates demonstrate momentum
- **Listen Actively**: Stakeholders often have valuable insights
- **Document Agreements**: Record decisions and commitments
- **Follow Through**: Do what you say you'll do

## Common challenges

**Too Many Stakeholders:**
- Prioritize based on influence and interest
- Create tiered communication approach
- Use async channels for lower-priority stakeholders

**Conflicting Priorities:**
- Use [prioritization frameworks](prioritization-frameworks.md) to make decisions
- Refer back to [product strategy](product-strategy-vision.md)
- Escalate to leadership when needed

**Lack of Engagement:**
- Make communication relevant and valuable
- Use formats stakeholders prefer
- Show how their input influences decisions

**Scope Creep:**
- Use [roadmap](roadmap-planning.md) to show what's planned
- Explain prioritization rationale
- Have a process for evaluating new requests
