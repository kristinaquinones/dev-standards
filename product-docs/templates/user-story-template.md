# User Story Template

## Format

```
As a [type of user],
I want to [perform an action],
So that [I achieve a benefit].
```

## Example

```
As a project manager,
I want to filter tasks by assignee,
So that I can quickly see what each team member is working on.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

List what must be true for this story to be complete:

- [ ] Criteria 1
- [ ] Criteria 2
- [ ] Criteria 3

**Example:**
- [ ] Filter dropdown appears in task list header
- [ ] User can select an assignee to filter by
- [ ] Filtered list shows only tasks for selected assignee
- [ ] User can clear filter to see all tasks

## Best Practices

- **Keep it small**: One story = one feature or task
- **User-focused**: Write from user perspective, not technical
- **Clear criteria**: Define what "done" means
- **Validate first**: If based on a hunch, validate with user research or a small experiment before building
