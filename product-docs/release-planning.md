# Release planning

## Overview

Release planning translates [roadmap](roadmap-planning.md) items into specific, deliverable releases. It involves scoping work, coordinating teams, and preparing for launch.

## Release principles

### Outcome-Focused

- Plan releases around outcomes, not just features
- Define success criteria for each release
- Measure impact after launch
- Be willing to adjust scope to achieve outcomes

### Incremental Value

- Each release should deliver value independently
- Avoid dependencies that block value delivery
- Consider phased rollouts for complex features
- Balance completeness with speed to market

### Coordination

- Align engineering, design, and product work
- Coordinate with marketing and sales for launch (see [GTM Launch Planning](../gtm-mktg-docs/gtm-launch-planning.md))
- Prepare support and documentation
- Plan for post-launch monitoring and iteration

## Release planning process

### Inputs

- [Roadmap](roadmap-planning.md) priorities and themes
- [Product & Design Process](product-design-process.md) and requirements
- Engineering capacity and constraints
- Design and research needs
- Strategic timelines and dependencies

### Planning Steps

1. **Define Release Goals**: What outcomes should this release achieve?
2. **Select Features**: Choose features that support release goals
3. **Scope Work**: Determine what's in and out of scope
4. **Sequence Work**: Order features based on dependencies
5. **Estimate Effort**: Validate feasibility with engineering
6. **Plan Launch**: Coordinate [go-to-market activities](../gtm-mktg-docs/gtm-launch-planning.md)
7. **Define Success**: Establish metrics and success criteria using [SMART goals framework](metrics-success-criteria.md#smart-goals-framework)
8. **Communicate Plan**: Share release plan with stakeholders

## Release scoping

### Scope Definition

**In Scope:**
- Features and improvements included in this release
- Clear boundaries and acceptance criteria
- Dependencies and prerequisites

**Out of Scope:**
- Features explicitly deferred to future releases
- Nice-to-haves that don't fit timeline
- Work that doesn't support release goals

### Scope Management

- **Use [Prioritization Frameworks](prioritization-frameworks.md)**: Make scope decisions objective
- **Apply [MoSCoW](prioritization-frameworks.md#moscow-prioritization)**: Categorize requirements
- **Protect Scope**: Resist scope creep during development
- **Be Flexible**: Adjust scope if learnings indicate changes needed

## Release coordination

### Cross-Functional Alignment

**Engineering:**
- Technical feasibility and constraints
- Dependencies and sequencing
- Capacity and timeline estimates
- Risk identification and mitigation

**Design:**
- User experience requirements
- Design assets and specifications
- Usability testing and validation
- Design system considerations

**Marketing:**
- [Launch messaging and positioning](../gtm-mktg-docs/positioning-messaging.md)
- Customer communication plans
- Press and analyst briefings
- Marketing asset requirements

**Sales:**
- Sales enablement materials
- Customer communication
- Pricing and packaging (if applicable)
- Competitive positioning

**Support:**
- Documentation and training needs
- Support playbooks
- Known issues and workarounds
- Escalation procedures

## Release timeline

### Typical Release Phases

**Planning (Weeks 1-2):**
- Define goals and scope
- Align on requirements
- Coordinate with teams
- Set success criteria using [SMART goals framework](metrics-success-criteria.md#smart-goals-framework)

**Development (Weeks 3-8):**
- Build and test features
- Regular check-ins and adjustments
- Design reviews and validations
- Prepare launch materials

**Pre-Launch (Week 9):**
- Final testing and QA
- Documentation completion
- Launch preparation
- Stakeholder communication

**Launch (Week 10):**
- Release deployment
- Monitoring and support
- Customer communication
- Initial feedback collection

**Post-Launch (Weeks 11-12):**
- Measure impact
- Gather feedback
- Identify improvements
- Plan next iteration

### Timeline Considerations

- **Buffer Time**: Build in time for unexpected issues
- **Dependencies**: Account for external dependencies
- **Quality**: Don't sacrifice quality for speed
- **Learning**: Allow time to measure and learn from releases

## Release communication

### Stakeholder Updates

- **Regular Status**: Weekly or bi-weekly progress updates
- **Milestone Reviews**: Checkpoints at key phases
- **Launch Announcements**: Pre-launch and launch communications
- **Post-Launch Results**: Share outcomes and learnings

### Release Notes

Release notes should include:
- **What's New**: Features and improvements in this release
- **Why It Matters**: Value and benefits for users
- **How to Use**: Guidance for new features
- **Known Issues**: Transparent about limitations or bugs

## Best practices

- **Start with Outcomes**: Define success before planning features
- **Be Realistic**: Don't over-commit; build in buffer time
- **Stay Flexible**: Adjust plans as you learn
- **Coordinate Early**: Involve all teams from the start
- **Communicate Often**: Keep stakeholders informed
- **Measure Impact**: Track success metrics after launch
- **Learn and Iterate**: Use release learnings to improve future releases

## Common pitfalls

- **Scope Creep**: Adding features mid-release without adjusting timeline
- **Over-Engineering**: Building more than needed for the release goal
- **Poor Coordination**: Teams working in silos without alignment
- **Unrealistic Timelines**: Not accounting for dependencies and complexity
- **Launch Without Preparation**: Insufficient marketing, support, or documentation
