# Roadmap Planning

## Overview

A product roadmap translates strategy into a tactical plan, showing what the team will build and when. Roadmaps should be flexible, strategic, and clearly communicate priorities to stakeholders.

## Roadmap principles

### Strategic Alignment

- Roadmaps should directly connect to [product strategy](product-strategy-vision.md)
- Each initiative should advance strategic goals
- Regularly validate that roadmap items still align with strategy

### Flexibility

- Roadmaps are plans, not commitments
- Update roadmaps as you learn and context changes
- Focus on outcomes, not specific features or dates
- Use time horizons rather than fixed dates for future work

### Communication

- Roadmaps are communication tools for stakeholders
- Different audiences may need different views (executive, engineering, design)
- Clearly communicate what's committed vs. what's planned
- Explain the "why" behind roadmap decisions

## Roadmap structure

### Time Horizons

**Now (0-3 months):**
- Committed work with clear scope
- High confidence in delivery
- Detailed planning and execution

**Next (3-6 months):**
- Planned work with defined outcomes
- Medium confidence, may shift
- Rough scope and priorities

**Later (6-12+ months):**
- Strategic themes and opportunities
- Low confidence, likely to change
- High-level direction only

### Roadmap Views

**Theme-Based:**
- Organized by strategic themes or goals
- Focuses on "why" and outcomes
- Less detail on specific features

**Feature-Based:**
- Organized by features or initiatives
- More tactical and detailed
- Easier to understand for technical teams

**Goal-Based:**
- Organized by strategic or user goals
- Outcome-focused
- Connects work to measurable results

## Roadmap planning process

### Inputs

- [Product Strategy](product-strategy-vision.md) and vision
- [User Research](user-research-discovery.md) insights
- Strategic goals and constraints
- Technical capabilities and limitations
- Market conditions and competitive landscape

### Prioritization

- Use [prioritization frameworks](prioritization-frameworks.md) to evaluate initiatives
- Consider dependencies and sequencing
- Balance quick wins with strategic investments
- Account for capacity and resource constraints

### Planning Steps

1. **Review Strategy**: Ensure roadmap aligns with strategic goals
2. **Gather Inputs**: Gather data from analytics, experiments, and user research. For instance, if stakeholders suggest a feature based on intuition, validate with user research first, then design an experiment to measure impact before adding to roadmap
3. **Identify Themes**: Group related work into strategic themes
4. **Prioritize**: Use frameworks to rank initiatives
5. **Sequence**: Order work based on dependencies and value
6. **Validate**: Check feasibility with engineering and design
7. **Communicate**: Share roadmap with stakeholders and gather feedback
8. **Iterate**: Update roadmap regularly based on learnings

## Roadmap communication

### Stakeholder Presentations

- **Executives**: Focus on strategic themes, product impact, and key metrics
- **Engineering**: Include technical context, dependencies, and capacity considerations
- **Design**: Highlight user impact and design requirements
- **Sales/Marketing**: Emphasize customer value and competitive advantages

### Roadmap Artifacts

- **Visual Roadmap**: Timeline or swimlane view showing themes/features over time
- **Strategic Roadmap**: High-level themes and goals
- **Tactical Roadmap**: Detailed features and initiatives
- **Release Roadmap**: Specific releases and deliverables

## Best practices

- **Keep It Strategic**: Focus on outcomes and themes, not just features
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Roadmap decisions should be informed by data - use analytics, experiments, and user research to validate priorities. Hunches about what users want should become research questions, then hypotheses to test, not direct roadmap items
- **Be Transparent**: Clearly show what's committed vs. planned
- **Update Regularly**: Review and refresh roadmaps quarterly or as context changes
- **Say No Gracefully**: Use the roadmap to explain why some requests aren't prioritized
- **Link to Strategy**: Always connect roadmap items back to strategic goals
- **Balance Time Horizons**: Mix quick wins with longer-term investments

## Common pitfalls

- **Over-Committing**: Promising too much too far in advance
- **Feature Factory**: Focusing on output (features) rather than outcomes
- **Ignoring Dependencies**: Not accounting for technical or resource dependencies
- **Static Planning**: Treating roadmap as fixed rather than living document
- **Lack of Context**: Not explaining the "why" behind roadmap decisions
